2’s complement is the way every computer represents a signed integer number in binary form, especially a negative number. 
To get 2's complement negative binary integer is simply write out positive binary, then invert all the digits and add one to the results.
For example, if you want to find -5 in the 4-bit binary, then you would have to:
1.)	Write out positive 5 in binary 
  0101
2.) Invert all the digits
  1010
3.) Add one to the result
  1011

It’s also worth to mention that 0 on the leftmost number represent positive integer numbers and 1 on the leftmost number present negative 
integer numbers. The reason signed negative number is using 2’s complement because without the 2’s complements the arithmetic operation on 
binary wouldn’t be correct. Let look at the example of adding binary number of 5 and -5 in which we only assume that leftmost is the sign 
bit. You would get 0101 for 5 and 1101 for -5. If you add those two numbers together, you would get 0010 which equals to 2 which clear is 
not correct result. Now let look at the example of the same addition but with 2’s complement, 5 would be 0101 and -5 would be 1011. 
After addition operation, you would get the result of 0000.
